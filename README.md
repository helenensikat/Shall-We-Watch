# About Shall-We-Watch

I have a lot of films I want to show Keith.  Keith has a lot of films he wants to show me.  We both have a lot of films we want to watch that neither of us have seen.  But sadly, we can never decide what to watch, so we never watch any of the films.

This is a silly command-line script to take four films from each of those lists and roll a virtual D12 to pick one from that shortlist of 12.
